# Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles which personalize my system. I like dotfiles.

## Installation

The first step is to clone this Git repository into the `~/.dotfiles` directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacobvaneijk/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Then, run the `dotfiles` script from the `bin` directory:

    $ ./.dotfiles/bin/dotfiles

This will install all of the dotfiles and make `dotfiles` script invokable
throughout your system by adding it to your `$PATH` environment variable.
